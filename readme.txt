== Description ==

This plugin removes the default stylesheet from your WordPress login and loads a new stylesheet from theme directory called login.css.  That’s all there is too it. No settings or configuration required. You will still need to create a stylesheet and place that in your theme directory.  You can also copy the code directly to your functions.php so the user won’t have to download this plugin.
